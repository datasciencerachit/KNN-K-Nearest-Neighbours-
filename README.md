# KNN-K-Nearest-Neighbours-
This is the KNN algorithm which is a famous Supervised Learning Model
KNN means the K nearest Neighbours which is a distance based machine learning model which computes the K nearest 
neigbours in the dataset which we provide
KNN makes a mathematical space called Vernoi Regions and thus segregates the classes
It is mainly used for classification Problems.
